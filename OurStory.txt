Last Tuesday, I was by Sidney Smith Hall.

I went to school early, eager to find some coffee. 

It was my first day of school so I wasn't sure where I could find a good coffee. It was 6am in the morning and there was nobody I could ask. 

I wandered the empty halls, peeking around corners, and smelling the air for any sign that I could get my caffeine-fix. Then, I heard a sound.

It was the sudden purr of the vending machine as its refrigeration systems flickered on. The sound pulled me closer as if it were calling me over. As I got closer, I saw a most peculiar sight.
