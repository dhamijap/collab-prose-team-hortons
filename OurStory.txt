One day,
I went to school early, eager to find some coffee. 

It was my first day of school so I wasn't sure where I could find a good coffee. It was 6am in the morning and there was nobody I could ask. I wandered the empty halls, peeking around corners, and smelling the air for any sign that I could get my caffeine-fix. Then, I heard a sound.
